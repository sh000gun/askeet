App\Entity\Question:
  q1:
    title: What shall I do tonight with my girlfriend?
    user_id: fabien
    body:  |
      We shall meet in front of the Dunkin'Donuts before dinner, 
      and I haven't the slightest idea of what I can do with her. 
      She's not interested in programming, space opera movies nor insects.
      She's kinda cute, so I really need to find something 
      that will keep her to my side for another evening.

  q2:
    title: What can I offer to my step mother?
    user_id: anonymous
    body:  |
      My stepmother has everything a stepmother is usually offered
      (watch, vacuum cleaner, earrings, del.icio.us account). 
      Her birthday comes next week, I am broke, and I know that 
      if I don't offer her something sweet, my girlfriend 
      won't look at me in the eyes for another month.

  q3:
    title: How can I generate traffic to my blog?
    user_id: francois
    body:  |
      I have a very swell blog that talks 
      about my class and mates and pets and favorite movies.

      You can try to read her poetry. Chicks love that kind of things.

      Don't bring her to a donuts shop. Ever. Girls don't like to be
      seen eating with their fingers - although it's nice.

      The answer is in the question: buy her a step, so she can 
      get some exercise and be grateful for the weight she will
      lose.
